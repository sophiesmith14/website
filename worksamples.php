<p> I can proudly say I have been contributing to the content of established publications every year since I was a freshman in high school. Beginning in college, I decided to narrow my focus to my passion for layout. Working on the Cornell Daily Sun’s design staff has provided me with time management skills and definitive concern for quality. I love creating a visual representation of written pieces in an aesthetically-pleasing style. For me, the process of reaching that polished, final product is the most rewarding part of production. Watching more experienced designers and editors work on layouts and stylistic aspects I might not even consider would be as fascinating an experience as calling a product my own. My experience in graphic design for advertisements and newspaper layout has allowed me to strengthen my skills in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Quark, and Illustrator.</p>

<p> Two summers ago, I honed my video production skills by simultaneously completing both a class at NYU and an internship which challenged me to produce multimedia marketing materials for a financial group. My work ranged from covering events in a journalistic context to breaking down complex economic strategies for wealthy clients. These seemingly different projects allowed me to practice executing the tasks associated with the creation of a video product meant for circulation. From balancing the background hum of New York City streets with my own raspy voiceover to correcting the fluorescent glare of a standard business park office using lighting equipment, I have gained the ability to recognize present and future problems on and off camera and do my best to solve them. I know I could be invaluable in video departments as a team player who’s ready to think on her feet and learn new techniques for rendering video content that meets incredibly high standards.

  Through various classes on marketing, persuasion, and advertising, I've had the opportunity to present business plans and pitches individually and in a group. One of my most successful presentations was last spring when I pitched a scripted, 8x60 series in a group of 5 students on the topic of epic, untold stories and we received the most votes from a panel of media executives out of 4 other pitches. </p>

    I've been interested in writing from an early age. I've had practice in newswriting for my high school paper and also in an eductaional setting. In my communication courses, I've written a multitude of research papers and close-analysis pieces using APA and MLA style. In my personal writing, I've developed a voice for blog-style writing which I refined in my study abroad blog.</p>
